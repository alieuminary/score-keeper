# Basketball Score Keeper
This is a simple practice project that keeps track of scoring for a basketball game. For now, it assumes every basket made is one point for each team.

## How It's Made
**Tech used**: HTML, CSS/Bulma, vanilla JavaScript

I started off with creating the basic HTML structure of the web page and adding event listeners in the elements with vanilla JS. CSS styling was the last step of the process. 
I started off with vanilla CSS then played around with a CSS framework called Bulma.

## Optimization
I refactored the logic code where I took advantage of creating objects, in this case p1 and p2 (player 1 and player 2). This allowed me to avoid code duplication and writing a cleaner looking code.

## Lessons Learned
After starting off with vanilla CSS then transition to a CSS framework like Bulma, I realized how styling can be. It doesn't always have to be this mundane and at a slow pace I thought. It really opened my eyes the benefit of CSS frameworks. Additionally, I got more comfortable adding event listeners by manipulating web page elements
